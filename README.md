# Video-Chatting
We can make video call from one user to another. Uses node.js, webRTC, Peer.js technology.
We can create a profile of a user by registration process. To store userâ€™s information we are using NoSQL (CouchDB) database. After registration process users can search his friend and add them. When s/he add friend and getting his/her friend online s/he can call them. If others friend receive the call they can talk. We can use this system on internet or local network. We need to use browser (like Google chrome, Firefox, opera etc. latest version).
